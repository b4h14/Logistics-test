# Logistics Operations Analyst Test

## 1. Introduction

This test is intended for candidates who are applying to Logistics Operations Analyst positions at CloudWalk.

If you are here, we already like you and see you as a good fit with our company. 
Now, we propose a challenge similar to the ones that we face on a daily basis.
The challenges were created with the objective of helping you build the knowledge base needed to implement 
the technical assessment in the end, enjoy!

- The first challenge is an analysis of hypothetical data.
- The second challenge is the actual implementation of a solution to a real world problem.

## 2. Pre-requisites

- Git
- A development environment
- Any analysis tool 

## 3. Tasks

### 3.1 - Get your hands dirty

Using [this csv](https://github.com/fabiomdlima/Logistics/blob/main/logistic-case-v4.csv) 
containing hypothetical delivery data, imagine that you are analyzing the performance of our logistics operators and the delivery of our products. Analyze the data and present your conclusions. In addition to the data in the spreadsheet, perform a SQL query, graph the results, and explain any anomalous behavior you find

### 3.2 Identify the problem
Our objective as a logistic team is to increase efficiency. In the given data, we found our answers and have taken steps to be not only better, but cheaper and more secure. How and why would *you* do it? 

Be free to use any helper you know of. ChatGPT, statistics, google.
Remember to document it and add it to the presentation

Guiding questions: 

    What questions should start your analysis?
    What does it means to be more "secure"?
    What are good KPIs to check for efficiency? 
    Which data should we examine more closely and why??
    Are we doing good? Are we doing bad?
    what are the strong and weak sides of our operation?
    What information would improve the decision-making process?
    What information makes your analysis wrong?

### 3.3 - Solve the problem
*Action plan - what would you do?*

We make deliveries from a nationally structured logistics partner with distribution centers and delivery partners strategically spread to serve all zip code ranges in the country.

Based on the data already analyzed, what would you do to reduce the average delivery time to 3 days?

If you were to ask the engineering teams to gather more data, what should it be and why?

What were the problems, how did you find them and what should we do to fix them?

## 4. Deliverables

You are expected to submit a compact git repository with your answers and project.
A presentation may help you to organize your ideas and better present them

## 5. Observation
If you are going to use a database to make your analysis, we have inserts ready in the insert.csv file; 

## Have fun
We hope you have fun, learn and challenge yourself during this task :)
